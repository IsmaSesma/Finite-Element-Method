# Finite-Element-Method

This repository consist of several MATLAB codes developed by me during an FEM course at University. The codes are mainly focused on solving discreet one and two dimensional bars 
and beams (both Euler-Bernulli's and Timoshenko's) under static forces.

The Matlab folder contain the code to solve different bars and beams with different loads and different geometric configurations. The Pr√°cticas folder contains the codes I developed during my internship at ETSIAE/UPM to solve a Free-Free beam with both discreet and contiuous approches. The code aims to optimize the geometric parameters of a 3D printed beam.
