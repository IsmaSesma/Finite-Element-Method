# Finite-Element-Method

This repository consist of several MATLAB codes developed by me during an FEM course at University. The codes are mainly focused on solving discreet one and two dimensional bars 
and beams (both Euler-Bernulli's and Timoshenko's) under static forces.

Right now I am working to udpate the code so it can be ussed for dynamic problems as well as considering continuous elements.
